# MongoDB Book App

## User Story
This project showcases how to connect the front-end to the back-end to have a successful book application.

## Instructions
Unfortunately, I cannot deploy this to Github Pages. However, you can test it out for yourselves:
1. Install MongoDB WITH MONGODB COMPASS.
    a. https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
    b. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard instructions.
    c. Add the MongoDB path to your system's PATH environment variable by following these instructions:
        i. Locate the MongoDB bin directory. The path should be similar to the following C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin where <version> should be replaced with the version number of MongoDB you have installed. Save this path, as you will need it later.
        ii. Open the System Properties:
                Right-click the “Start” button and select “System.”
                Select “Advanced system settings” on the left sidebar. This step opens the “System Properties” window.
        iii. Environment Variables:
                In the “System Properties” window, go to the “Advanced” tab and select the “Environment Variables...” button at the bottom.
        iv. Modify the PATH Environment Variable:
                In the “Environment Variables” window, scroll down under the “System variables” section, select the variable called “Path,” and then select “Edit...”.
                In the “Edit Environment Variable” window, select “New” and paste the path to your MongoDB bin directory you copied in step 3a of this activity.
        v. Save and Exit:
                Select “OK” to close the “Edit Environment Variable” window.
                Select “OK” again to close the “Environment Variables” window.
                Select “OK” once more to close the “System Properties” window.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Go to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then run it using npm run start.
4. Go to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then run it using npm start.
