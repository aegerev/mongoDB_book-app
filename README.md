## User Story
This project showcases how to connect the front-end to the back-end to have a successful book application.

## Instructions
Unfortunately, I cannot deploy this to Github Pages. However, you can test it out for yourselves:
1. Install MongoDB WITH MONGODB COMPASS. <br/>
    a. https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community<br/>
    b. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard instructions.<br/>
    c. Add the MongoDB path to your system's PATH environment variable by following these instructions:<br/>
        i. Locate the MongoDB bin directory. The path should be similar to the following C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin where <version> should be replaced with the version number of MongoDB you have installed. Save this path, as you will need it later.<br/>
        ii. Open the System Properties:<br/>
                Right-click the “Start” button and select “System.”<br/>
                Select “Advanced system settings” on the left sidebar. This step opens the “System Properties” window.<br/>
        iii. Environment Variables:<br/>
                In the “System Properties” window, go to the “Advanced” tab and select the “Environment Variables...” button at the bottom.<br/>
        iv. Modify the PATH Environment Variable:<br/>
                In the “Environment Variables” window, scroll down under the “System variables” section, select the variable called “Path,” and then select “Edit...”.<br/>
                In the “Edit Environment Variable” window, select “New” and paste the path to your MongoDB bin directory you copied in step 3a of this activity.<br/>
        v. Save and Exit:<br/>
                Select “OK” to close the “Edit Environment Variable” window.<br/>
                Select “OK” again to close the “Environment Variables” window.<br/>
                Select “OK” once more to close the “System Properties” window.<br/>
2. Clone the repository.<br/>
3. Go to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then run it using npm run start.<br/>
4. Go to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then run it using npm start.<br/>
